1.    Load the data
2.    Take a quick look at the data such as using head, describe, info
3.    Split your data into training and test set (no data snooping!)

4.    Explore data and visualize the data to gain insights
	a. identify %missing values
	b. study correlation
	c. visualize data

5.    Data Preprocessing

6.    Modelling
	a.    Apply few algorithms/models
	b.    Select few promising ones by evaluating them using validation set

7.    Fine tune the short-listed models and combine them into a great solution.

8.    Evaluate Your System on the Test Set
